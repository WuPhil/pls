# I think ima repurpose this to projects that I thought of on the spot and work on for ~20 min </br>
## Some Current Projects
1) EightyNineSix: Is it more likely to get an 89.5 or 89.6, given some number of points for a class? </br>
2) Exproximations: Given 2 exponentials, what ratio is going to be the closest to 1? (Will allow accurate guesses of even bigger exponentials) </br>
3) In dev, but more crypto tools and whatnot because I am not a sage mastermind. (really use sage lmaoo)
## Todos
For project 1) Add more casework: What if the digits were just truncated? What if there are differently categories with different weights? (Really an excuse for me to get back into Java) </br>
Project 2) Add base configuration, have file writing attempts, make list with top n ratios (also clean up output) </br>
